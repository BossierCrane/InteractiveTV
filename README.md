# InteractiveTV
The interactive tv project was created for a capstone Creative Industries unit at QUT for a client, the Starlight Children's foundation. The brief was for the creation of a new venture for Starlight to furthere their goals in adding excitement and joy to children in hospitals. As such, we decided to create an improved and interactive version of Starlight Tv, which at the time of development, was running soley out of major pediatric hospitals, each with their own content. Our demonstration showcased an interactive show which could be viewed simultaneously as a live stream, with interaction on the choices the protagonist takes, essentially becoming a democratic choose your own adventure. The elements in this git file are solely for the front end of the project, and some assets were solely for either design use, or testing use for various methods of providing the content.
